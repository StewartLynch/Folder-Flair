# **üìÅ Folder Flair**

**Folder Flair** is a macOS app that lets you customize your Finder folder icons with style, including colors, emojis, images, and over 6,000 SF Symbols.

This app was very much a ‚Äúvibe-coded‚Äù project. It was developed with help from ChatGPT, but all design decisions and refinements were made by me. I‚Äôm sharing the source code for anyone who wants to build the app, customize it, or simply explore how it works.

I am not looking for feedback or comments on the coding style.  If you want, you can fork the branch and make your own enhancements and changes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: macOS 26 introduces native folder customization that will overlap with some of Folder Flair‚Äôs features. However, this app still offers options that macOS does not, such as support for custom images, scaling, and rotation.

> Keep in mind that if a Folder Flair icon is applied, macOS 26 disables the folder‚Äôs opening animation when dragging in content. Tagging support remains unchanged.
> If you build the app with Xcode 26, the application will recognize the version of macOS and use the correct base folder icon.

If you prefer not to build the app yourself, you can download the installer below.
